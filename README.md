# California Housing Prices Prediction

This project is an implementation of the End-to-End Machine Learning Project outlined in Chapter 2 of "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. The objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts the median housing prices in California districts using various features such as population, median income, and location.

## Project Overview

The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: Utilized the California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository.

2. **Data Exploration**: Performed an initial examination of the dataset to understand its structure and identify patterns or anomalies.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values appropriately.
   - Transformed categorical attributes into numerical formats.
   - Engineered new features to enhance model performance.

4. **Feature Scaling**: Applied scaling techniques to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

5. **Model Training**: Employed a Random Forest Regressor to predict median housing prices.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Key Findings

- **Median Income**: Identified as the most significant predictor for median housing prices, highlighting its importance in the model.

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features, such as rooms per household and bedrooms per room, contributed to improved model accuracy.

- **Model Performance**: The Random Forest model demonstrated robust performance, effectively capturing complex relationships within the data.
